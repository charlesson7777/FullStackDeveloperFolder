    <!-- span - A container for small pieces of text. If a div is 
        like a cardboard box, a span is like a Ziploc bag. It doesn't 
        change the styling of anything by itself but it allows you use
        CSS and JavaScript later to make that text different in some way.
         Example: <p>Here is some text. < span>This text is in a span</span> 
        but it doesn't look any different.</p>-->
    <p>
      This is
      <span style="text-decoration: underline">important text</span> that we
      need
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>The first Name</li>
      <li>The Middle Name</li>
      <li>The Last name</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>Mango</li>
      <li>Avocado</li>
      <li>Peach</li>
    </ul>

    <!--button - A... button. A button can be used by JavaScript to respond 
        to a user clicking it, or it can be used by a form to signal a user has 
        completed filling it and it should submit the data. Think of it like a 
        doorbell to your house: you can put the doorbell button there but it's 
        not going to do much unless you connect it to the buzzer. Example: 
        <button>Click me!!</button>-->

    <button>Click me!! I don't do anything</button>

    <!--img - An image. You use this to load images onto the page. 
        This can be confusing because you can use CSS to bring in images too. 
        The key difference is that when the image is apart of the content, 
        like a diagram that shows data you're talking about or a picture 
        that shows something from the article, it should be an img tag. 
        If it's a nice background image or something that's for decoration 
        of your website, use CSS. An img tag needs a src to say where the 
        image is coming from and alt to say what is in the image for screen 
        readers so that the image will still be useful to blind people, 
        people who are hard of seeing, and Google and Bing search engines.
        img are always self-closing tags. Example: 
        <img src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog25.jpg" alt="an adorable dog" />-->

    <img
      src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog25.jpg"
      alt="an adorable dog"
    />
    <img
      src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog26.jpg"
      alt="an adorable dog"
    />
    <img
      src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog27.jpg"
      alt="an adorable dog"
    />

    <!--input - Browser inputs. Sometimes you need to gather input from the user.
        Luckily for us, the browser is already really good at doing that. It gives 
        us several types of inputs that you can use. One of the most common ones 
        is the text input, seen here: Brian You can also have these input tags do numbers, 
        dates, colors, checkboxes, radio buttons, and others. We'll explore them more 
        later when we talk about forms. Inputs are always self-closing tags. Example: <input />.-->
    <ul>
      <li><input /></li>
      <li><input type="text" /></li>
      <li><input type="color" /></li>
      <li><input type="file" /></li>
      <li><input type="number" /></li>
      <li><input type="datetime-local" /></li>
      <li><input type="radio" /></li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" /></li>
    </ul>

    <!--textarea - Similar to an input but for a lot more text. 
    You'd type long-form responses in here that could linebreaks 
    in it (a linebreak happens when you hit "return" or "enter" on your keyboard.)
Despite never having anything inside of a textarea, it is not a self-closing tag. 
HTML is a really old language and so we have to live with some old quirks.
 Example: <textarea></textarea>-->

    <textarea name="Comments" id="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
  </body>
</html>
